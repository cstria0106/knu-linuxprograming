N. Korea Suggests Family Reunions

In a surprise gesture of reconcilation that could ease tensions on the
divided Korea Peninsula, North Korea proposed to South Korea on Saturday
that they arrange reunions of families separated by a war six decades ago.

Family reunions have usually been proposed by the South, not the North.
The North's initiative showed how the humanitarian program is used as a
chip in the complex diplomacy surrounding the peninsula.

But the South has refused to resume aid shipments or six-nation talks on
ending North Korea's nuclear weapons development before North Korea
apologizes for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, which killed
46 sailors. The North has denied involvement in the sinking but the South has insisted on the North making gestures to mollify South Koreans.

The proposal came a day before Stephen W. Bosworth, Washington's top envoy
on North Korea, was to arrive in Seoul in the first leg of a regional trip aimed at resuming the nuclear talks.

South Korea was "favorably" reviewing the offer for immediate discussions of family reunions so the reunions could take place in North Korea's Diamont Mountain resort around the Sept. 22 Chuseok fall-harvest holiday, a
government statement said.
