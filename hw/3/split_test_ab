About 20,000 Koreans have been temporarily reunited since the two Koreas
held their first summit meeting in 2000. The last such reunions were a year
ago, and thousands of older South Koreans wait for a chance to meet
relatives not seen for 60 years.

The scenes of teary people hugging long-lost parents and children have
previously helped sway South Korean opinion in favor of engaging the North.
Meanwhile, North Korea has used the reunions to win economic concessions
from the South.

Although the new proposal is a sharp departure from the North's recent
invective against South Korea, it remains nuclear whether the South
considers it enough to change a stance hardened by the warship's sinking.

"We wonder about the North's motive behind this unexpected proposal, but
whatever it might be, we must say we welcome the offer," Ahn Hyoung-hwan,
a governing party spokeman in Seoul, told reporters. Opposition parties
also welcomed the initiative.
