North and South Korea agree to family reunions in October
----------------------------------------------------------
Families split by the war and division of North and South Korea will
reunite in a brief series of meetings next month, South Korea's Unification
Ministry said in a statement. The Koreas have agreed to allow the reunion
and his family. "It was shocking," Jang said. "I didn't even know they
were alive, although I had hoped they were. After reading the letter,
I started crying, I was filled with both joy and sorrow."

Jang's family sobbed when they finally met, and vowed to somehow see
each other again. The Korean Peninsula was effectively split in two
during the Korean War. The fighting ended with the signing of the Korean
Armistice Agreement in 1953, which created the heavily-guarded
Demilitarized Zone. However, as no peace agreement was signed,
technically the two sides are still at war.
